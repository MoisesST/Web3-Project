## About :

Project developed for the discipline **Web 3** with a focus on the back-end. The project depends on the framework built by Professor Guilerme. The professor set us diferents topics of projects, I like this one Roles, the name of this project is similar to a word in english but in Brasil means places, it's just a nicer way of saying places. So as not to confuse, I changed the name to **Rolles**, I don't know if it improved, but I put it anyway.

This is my first deploy and you can check it out by accessing this [link](https://rolles.000webhostapp.com/rolles/site/rolles).
